          While in school, I spent time building my coding abilities, starting
          from ruby on rails and working on React javascript, I came to be able
          to adapt and grasp any language I put my mind to. I have worked on my
          own time and at my current internship, with redux, hooks, typescript,
          Mongo DB, writing JSON files, stripe, and other tools. I am focused
          and diligent when managing workloads and prioritizing tasks to meet
          deadlines. I thrive in environments where I am able to make a direct
          impact, utilizing my abilities in complex problem-solving to find
          solutions and achieve results. I also love to learn what I don't know.
          As for my background, I grew up with a single mom, a strong woman, who
          raised me well, but we had no English language(we are Russian), so it
          was quite difficult for us at first. But I was fast to grasp the
          English language and learned a lot. I loved building since childhood
          and that's partially the reason I got into coding. I'm not sure about
          the program I used but from day one when I was able to write some code
          and see instant results, the step by step process of my code on the
          console, I grew a passion for coding. My most valuable skills are my
          desire to learn and adapt to new environments and my knowledge of the
          Russian and Ukrainian language(if ever needed). I have a grasp in
          different technologies and more is said about it and my internship on
          my resume. <br />
